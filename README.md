# Local Leaderboard

## Description

LocalLeaderboard saves all of your results from playing a level to a JSON file, which is then displayed in-game. The UI shows the date of a play, your accuracy, your score, modifiers, and more. The mod also allows you to sort by date or by high-score with an option for ascending or descending order.
